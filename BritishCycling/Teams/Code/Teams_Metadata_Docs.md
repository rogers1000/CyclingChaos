Teams Profile Metadata is a manual task due to the nature of the data not being readily available in table form but in individual website pages on the British Cycling website.

UCI teams are held on the UCI website but it was easier to manually copy/paste the data required. Link to this page is: https://www.uci.org/riders/road-riders-teams/4uEfOErsvL4hkRJriqkdiw?tab=riders-list-teams&page=1

EDT’s single source of truth is a webpage for each year as linked below.

I manually put in the British Cycling Team ID in this from the results page for each team and then merged the data so that it aligns with the others. 

I created a ZR_Team_ID as a (hopefully) temporary solution to UCI IDs changing year to year so it is obvious which teams are the same with Cycling’s team names being the sponsors. For those that aren’t UCI Conti or EDT, I filled in as “BC Club Team”.
